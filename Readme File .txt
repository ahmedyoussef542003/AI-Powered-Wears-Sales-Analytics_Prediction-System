Strategic Profit Optimization: Revenue & Returns Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on a dual-strategy approach to increasing net profit: Maximizing Revenue Efficiency and Minimizing Operational Leakage. By analyzing sales performance alongside return patterns, this dashboard identifies actionable opportunities to reclaim lost revenue and optimize product-level profitability without increasing base costs.


Dashboard 1: Revenue & Margin Hub
This phase analyzes how pricing, product categories, and discounts impact the bottom line.


Core Financial Health
Cost Efficiency: Despite aggressive discounting, the business maintains an exceptional 54% profit margin, signaling strong overall health.


Discount Control: A high average discount of 22% drives volume but requires tighter management to protect long-term brand value.


Performance Leaders
Top Categories: Hoodies & Sweatshirts lead total sales (nearly $1M), followed closely by Jackets ($900K).


Star SKUs: Demand is highly concentrated; the Hyperion Elements Jacket (~$109K) and Orion Two Tone Fitted Jacket (~$106K) are the top-performing products.


Winning Colors: Blue is the most profitable color (~$704K), followed by Green and Black, highlighting clear customer preferences.


Profitability Gaps
The Discount Trap: Tee products receive the highest discounts (30%+) but fail to generate strong profit, proving that aggressive discounting is ineffective for this category.





Dashboard 2: Returns & Leakage Control
This phase targets the $8.03K lost to returns and identifies specific "drain points" in the operation.

Key Return Metrics
Total Loss: 528 items were returned, totaling a direct cost of $8,030.

Baseline Performance: While the overall return rate is low and stable at 0.2%, granular spikes offer significant room for profit recovery.

Root Cause Analysis
Temporal Spikes: October saw the highest return rate (0.047), likely due to seasonal transitions or sizing issues with new winter inventory.

Geographic Clusters: Returns are not driven by distance alone; specific "geographic clusters" (peaking at 0.5%) suggest localized shipping or packaging inefficiencies.

Regional Drain: Scotland is the highest return territory (0.003 rate), specifically within the Central area (>0.005 rate), signaling a need for carrier performance reviews in those hubs.

Product-Specific Issues: * Category: Bras & Tops, Tank Tops, and Tees are the highest return drivers (0.003), suggesting inaccuracies in size guides.

Visual Mismatch: Pink and Gray products have the highest return rates, indicating a potential mismatch between online images and reality.






Strategic Recommendations
Reclaim October Profits: Increase Quality Control (QC) during the October seasonal shift to mitigate the annual return surge.

Fix Localized Logistics: Audit shipping partners and packaging standards specifically for the Central Scotland region to stop geographic profit drain.

Optimize Product Content: Update sizing guides for Tops and recalibrate product photography for Pink and Gray items to better align customer expectations.

Refine Discount Strategy: Reduce the 30%+ discounts on Tees and reallocate that margin toward promoting high-performing Blue Hoodies and Jackets.
